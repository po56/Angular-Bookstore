 * Given a list of items i and a size n, we want to:
 * 1. Find out how many items are in the list and calculate how many pages it would take to render i with a maximum of n items per page
 * 2. Create a list of pages to represent this. When we click on any page number we should be able to get to the next n items in i 
 * 3. Paginate results such that we have to change page every n items in i
